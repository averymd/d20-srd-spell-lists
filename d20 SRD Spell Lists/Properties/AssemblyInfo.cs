[assembly: AssemblyDescription(@"<p>This program uses Open Game Content from the d20 System. It's not intended to replace having the 
    relevant sourcebooks for full descriptions, but rather to be a tool in at-table roleplaying.</p>
    <p>If you encounter any issues, feature requests, or questions, please visit the app's <a href=""http://thecharonsheet.com/d20-spell-lists/"">homepage</a> 
    and contact me using one of the methods there.</p>
    <p>Major kudos to the following projects:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href=""http://www.andargor.com/"">Andargor</a>'s SRD 3.5 Database - The spell list (in XML format) is what's used here for the base spells.</li>
        <li><a href=""http://www.codeproject.com/KB/grid/GridDrawer.Net.aspx"">GridDrawer</a> - Used (with some tweaks) to print the spell lists.</li>
        <li><a href=""http://www.famfamfam.com/"">FamFamFam</a> - Their Silk icons grace these forms, although I had to create my own print preview icon.</li>
